LangChain
Kata 1: Creating a Simple LLM-powered Chatbot with LangChain
Objective: Build a basic chatbot using LangChain and connect it to an LLM for conversational responses.
Task:
Use LangChain to set up a conversational agent that interacts with an LLM (e.g., GPT-4).
The chatbot should be able to maintain context across conversations by using LangChain's memory capabilities.
Steps:
Install and set up LangChain.
Implement a simple chatbot that interacts with a language model.
Add memory to the chatbot to maintain the context of the conversation.
Enhance the bot to remember specific details, like the user's name or preferences.
Expected Outcome:
A chatbot that provides context-aware responses and remembers user-specific information across different turns in the conversation.
