Kata 3: Building a Contextual LLM Application with Vector Database
Objective: Create a contextual chatbot that uses a vector database to retrieve relevant information from a document corpus.
Task:
Build a basic chatbot that uses a vector database to retrieve relevant information based on user input.
The chatbot should retrieve similar documents from a preloaded knowledge base (corpus) and present them as responses.
Fine-tune the LLM's responses based on the retrieved documents.
Steps:
Preprocess a document corpus by generating embeddings using an LLM.
Store these embeddings in the vector database.
Implement a chatbot interface where user input is embedded and used to query the vector database for relevant documents.
Use the retrieved documents to generate or enhance the chatbot's response.
Expected Outcome:
A chatbot that can understand user queries and provide relevant responses using the content of the preloaded document corpus.
