## 4. Large Language Models

### Problem 1

Develop a News Summarization tool that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide concise summaries of news articles. This project focuses on understanding LLM fundamentals, API integration, and incorporating basic model selection and customization for text summarization.

Create a command-line tool or web application that takes a URL to a news article, extracts the content, and uses an LLM to generate a summary. This streamlined assignment concentrates on the essentials of LLM integration and handling article content.

**Tasks:**

1. Take new articles on various dates and create summaries of it.
2. Come up with a json of date, summary and articleType keys
    
    Ex: { “date”:”1st April 2024”, “summary”:”some summary”, ”articleType”:”financial”}
    
3. Ask questions from the json created.

### Deliverables:

- Source code for the news summarization tool, including any necessary configuration files and dependencies.
- A README file with detailed installation and usage instructions.
- A brief report that outlines:
    - The process of integrating the LLM API for summarization tasks.
    - How the tool extracts and processes article content.
    - A discussion on the approach to managing API usage costs.
    - Reflections on the challenges encountered during development and potential improvements for future versions.
