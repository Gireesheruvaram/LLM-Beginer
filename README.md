LangChain
Kata 1: Creating a Simple LLM-powered Chatbot with LangChain
Objective: Build a basic chatbot using LangChain and connect it to an LLM for conversational responses.
Task:
Use LangChain to set up a conversational agent that interacts with an LLM (e.g., GPT-4).
The chatbot should be able to maintain context across conversations by using LangChain's memory capabilities.
Steps:
Install and set up LangChain.
Implement a simple chatbot that interacts with a language model.
Add memory to the chatbot to maintain the context of the conversation.
Enhance the bot to remember specific details, like the user's name or preferences.
Expected Outcome:
A chatbot that provides context-aware responses and remembers user-specific information across different turns in the conversation.

Kata 1: Storing and Querying Embeddings
Objective: Learn how to store embeddings in a vector database and query it using cosine similarity.
Task:
Install a vector database library like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.
Generate embeddings from a set of text documents using an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's API or Hugging Face models).
Store the generated embeddings in the vector database.
Perform a query on the vector database by converting a query text into its embedding and finding the closest matches using cosine similarity.
Steps:
Install necessary packages and initialize the vector database.
Create embeddings using an LLM.
Insert embeddings into the vector database.
Implement a cosine similarity search and return the top N closest documents.
Expected Outcome:
A function that accepts a query and returns the most relevant documents based on vector similarity.

Kata 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain
Objective: Build a knowledge-enhanced LLM by integrating LangChain's document retrieval capabilities.
Task:
Use LangChain’s retrieval tools to augment a language model's capabilities by retrieving relevant information from a document store.
The model should be able to answer questions by querying a local or external database or knowledge base.
Steps:
Set up a document store (e.g., using Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, or another vector database).
Implement LangChain’s document retrieval functionality.
Connect the LLM to retrieve documents based on user queries and use the retrieved information to generate contextually accurate responses.
Expected Outcome:
A system where the LLM pulls relevant documents or facts from a database to enhance its responses with factual information, mimicking a knowledge-augmented chatbot.
