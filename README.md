Kata 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain
Objective: Build a knowledge-enhanced LLM by integrating LangChain's document retrieval capabilities.
Task:
Use LangChain’s retrieval tools to augment a language model's capabilities by retrieving relevant information from a document store.
The model should be able to answer questions by querying a local or external database or knowledge base.
Steps:
Set up a document store (e.g., using Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, or another vector database).
Implement LangChain’s document retrieval functionality.
Connect the LLM to retrieve documents based on user queries and use the retrieved information to generate contextually accurate responses.
Expected Outcome:
A system where the LLM pulls relevant documents or facts from a database to enhance its responses with factual information, mimicking a knowledge-augmented chatbot.
