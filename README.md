LangChain
Kata 1: Creating a Simple LLM-powered Chatbot with LangChain
Objective: Build a basic chatbot using LangChain and connect it to an LLM for conversational responses.
Task:
Use LangChain to set up a conversational agent that interacts with an LLM (e.g., GPT-4).
The chatbot should be able to maintain context across conversations by using LangChain's memory capabilities.
Steps:
Install and set up LangChain.
Implement a simple chatbot that interacts with a language model.
Add memory to the chatbot to maintain the context of the conversation.
Enhance the bot to remember specific details, like the user's name or preferences.
Expected Outcome:
A chatbot that provides context-aware responses and remembers user-specific information across different turns in the conversation.

Kata 1: Storing and Querying Embeddings
Objective: Learn how to store embeddings in a vector database and query it using cosine similarity.
Task:
Install a vector database library like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.
Generate embeddings from a set of text documents using an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's API or Hugging Face models).
Store the generated embeddings in the vector database.
Perform a query on the vector database by converting a query text into its embedding and finding the closest matches using cosine similarity.
Steps:
Install necessary packages and initialize the vector database.
Create embeddings using an LLM.
Insert embeddings into the vector database.
Implement a cosine similarity search and return the top N closest documents.
Expected Outcome:
A function that accepts a query and returns the most relevant documents based on vector similarity.
