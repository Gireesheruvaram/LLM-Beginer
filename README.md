Kata 2: Chain of Thought Prompting using LangChain
Objective: Implement a chain of thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism where the LLM explains its reasoning process step by step.
Task:
Use LangChain to create a system where the LLM provides reasoning steps for each query it receives.
You will explore how LangChain's tools can be used to build complex chains that require multi-step reasoning (e.g., arithmetic, logical queries).
Steps:
Set up LangChain with a language model.
Implement a prompt template to force the model to explain its steps using CoT reasoning.
Handle user inputs that require multi-step processes, like math problems or logical puzzles, where the LLM needs to output step-by-step reasoning.
Expected Outcome:
A system where the LLM responds to queries with explanations of its thought process before providing the final answer.
