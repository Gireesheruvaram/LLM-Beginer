**Scenario**: You are building a RAG-based system to analyze customer reviews and classify them as positive or negative. You have a dataset of customer reviews stored in a CSV file, along with their sentiment labels (positive or negative). Here's your task:

1. Load the customer review data from the CSV file using Pandas.
2. Preprocess the review text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation.
3. Calculate the average word count for positive and negative reviews.
4. Visualize the distribution of word count for positive and negative reviews using Matplotlib
5. Plot a positive review and observe it should be near the positive sentiments clusters
