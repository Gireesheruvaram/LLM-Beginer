            "Response: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines large language models with document retrieval systems to generate contextually accurate answers. It involves retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and using them as context for the language model's response. RAG provides factually accurate responses, enables dynamic knowledge updates, and scales well with large document repositories. It is commonly used in knowledge-based chatbots, personalized tutoring systems, document summarization tools, and real-time technical support systems.\n",

            "Response: LangChain uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle document retrieval. When a query is sent to the system, the retriever component searches the document store for relevant content. The retrieved documents are then passed to a large language model (LLM) as additional context. The LLM generates a response based on the combined query and the retrieved information. This approach ensures contextually accurate answers by leveraging both the retrieved documents and the language model's capabilities.\n",
