Intro
Kata 1: Analyze Attention Maps for a Sentence
Objective: Explore how attention is distributed across different tokens in a sentence.
Task:
Choose a simple sentence (e.g., "The cat sat on the mat").
Imagine or sketch an attention map showing how each word in the sentence might focus on other words using the attention mechanism.
Explain why certain words would pay more attention to others (e.g., subject-verb relations, important context).
Steps:
Review how attention mechanisms work from "The Illustrated Transformer."
Think about which words would focus on each other. For example, "cat" might focus more on "sat" than "mat."
Create a basic attention map (on paper or digitally) to show which tokens attend to others and why.
Expected Outcome:
A hand-drawn or digitally created attention map for a simple sentence, with a brief explanation of why specific words focus on others.


"Explain how attention mechanisms work in a Transformer model. Include details about Query, Key, Value, and how attention scores are calculated."
Attention mechanisms in Transformer models are a crucial component that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions.
